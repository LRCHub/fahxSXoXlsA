Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Tell me how to drive with the windows down
Now that you're not in the passenger seat
Tell me how to dance with my best friends
Guess that my best friends know that you're not with me

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I don't hate you, I just gotta learn to
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Summer days are lonely
When it's only me in my room
Wondering if you know that I'm
Still singing about you, ooh
Found your Dirty Nikes, they remind me
Of what I've been through
You should know it makes me sick
That I'm still singing 'bout you, ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (oh-oh, oh)
I don't hate you, I just gotta learn to
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (oh-oh, oh)
I don't hate you, I just gotta learn to

Remember when we talked through the the whole damn night
'Bout the things we'd never say out loud?
Remember when you said that you found the one?
We were driving home with the windows down
I'd love to unlove you
I want to unwant you
I need to, I need you
I need to be free too

Summer days are lonely
When it's only me in my room
Wondering if you know that I'm
Still singing about you, ooh
Found your Dirty Nikes, they remind me
Of what I've been through
You should know it makes me sick
That I'm still singing 'bout you, ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (oh-oh, oh)
I don't hate you, I just gotta learn to
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (oh-oh, ooh-ooh)
I don't hate you, I just gotta learn to
Drive with the windows down
Now that you're not in the passenger seat
Dance with my best friend's
Guess that my best friend's know that you're not with me

Oh-oh, oh
I don't hate you, I just gotta learn to
Oh-oh, oh
