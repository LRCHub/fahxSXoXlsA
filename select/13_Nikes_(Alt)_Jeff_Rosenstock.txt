Looking down the barrel of a shitty future
Throwing back whatever we can to avoid
The dread of what's been said
But there's just no escaping it

Trying to find the words to explain what it feels like
Buggin' out like, "Wait, did I say something weird?"
But that is just the price
Of faking like we're innocent

Chasing bliss
Chasing bliss
Is only numbing it

Looking for a dream that won't morph to a nightmare
Lying to myself about things that I love
'Cause I'm distracted by
Public displays of happiness

So I scour the internet for a new pair of Nikes
Status symbol shit that I say I'm above
Disown control, oh no
Oh no, I'm fucking full of shit!

Stinkin' rich
Hypocrite
No, it's not gonna bring no happiness
No, it's not gonna bring no happiness

There's no vacant bliss
There's no vacant bliss
There's no vacant bliss
There's no vacant bliss, no, no, no!
