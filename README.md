[01:51.68] His girl keep the scales
[01:53.31] A little mermaid

[02:24.04] But he cares for me
[02:26.97] And that's good enough
[02:33.37] We don't talk much or nothin'
[02:37.18] But when we talkin' 'bout somethin'

[03:18.58] Living so the last night feels like a past life

[03:36.66] 
[03:26.52] Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking yarmulke?
[03:28.69] Acid on me like the rain
[03:30.04] Weed crumbles into glitter
[03:32.12] Rain, glitter
[03:35.77] We laid out on this wet floor
[03:37.52] Away turf, no Astro
[03:39.04] Mesmerized how the strobes glow
[03:41.54] Look at all the people feet dance
[03:58.04] 
[03:42.84] I know that your nigga came, witcha
[03:47.69] But he ain't, witcha
[03:49.99] We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
[03:52.09] I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
[03:53.97] We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
[03:55.66] Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
[03:57.03] Feelin'
[04:00.53] 
[03:59.05] I may be younger, but I'll look after you
[04:00.95] We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
[04:13.03] When you're not here
[04:14.67] I'll save some for you
[04:19.79] I'm not him
[04:25.29] 
[04:23.10] But I'll mean something to you
[04:25.75] I'll mean something to you
[04:32.11] I'll mean something to you
[04:41.18] You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
[04:47.47] It's only awkward if you're fucking him too
